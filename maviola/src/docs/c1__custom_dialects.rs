# 📖 3.1. Custom Dialects

<em>[← Networks & Routing](crate::docs::b4__networks_and_routing) | [Custom Transport →](crate::docs::c2__custom_transport)</em>

It is possible to generate additional custom dialects from MAVLink XML definitions. We use
[MAVSpec](https://gitlab.com/mavka/libs/mavspec) as code generator. Please, refer to its
documentation for details.

We will extend this page once we come up with an interesting example.
