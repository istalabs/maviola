# 📖 4.2. Implementation Notes

<em>[← Guidelines](crate::docs::e1__guidelines) | [Testing →](crate::docs::e3__testing)</em>

This section is reserved for implementation notes. The only important thing we want to mention is
that this library will never be `no_std` compatible. For `no_std` (and no-alloc) functionality
we use [Mavio](https://gitlab.com/mavka/libs/mavio). We hope, that eventually we would be able to
lift as much useful features as possible to the latter crate.
