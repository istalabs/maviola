//! # Abstractions for closable tasks and resources
//!
//! This module provides abstractions for resources which state has to be tracked in distributed
//! computations.
//!
//! There are three level of resource ownership:
//!
//! * [`Closer`] represents a resource which is closed when its owner goes out of scope (similar to
//!   the regular Rust ownership model). This struct is intentionally not [`Clone`].
//! * [`SharedCloser`] represent a resources with shared owners, that is valid while at least one
//!   of the owners has a copy (similar to [`Arc`]). This struct implements [`Clone`].
//! * [`Closable`] represents a dependent resource or task which is notified when resource is no
//!   longer available. A [`Closable`] is read-only.
//!
//! Each level may be "downgraded" to a lower one. A [`Closer`] can produce a [`SharedCloser`], and
//! both of them can create a [`Closable`].
//!
//! All eventually "closable" entities implement trait [`WillClose`], as well as [`Closed`], a
//! constant type which is always closed.
//!
//! It is possible to close [`Closer`] and [`SharedCloser`] prematurely. Still, this requires
//! mutable access to the instance. That means that owner of a closer will have access over what
//! borrowers can and can't do with the state.
//!
//! The idea behind this hierarchy is that an expensive resource like a server listener ([`Closer`])
//! may be bounded to several co-dependent resources like connection interfaces exposed to a library
//! client ([`SharedCloser`]). If one of the sides are gone, then all should stop. Furthermore,
//! entities like individual peer connections are purely dependant. Which means, their state does
//! not define the state of the server, but at the same time they have to monitor the global state
//! and stop when the main system is stopped.

/// [`Closer`] is owned by a resource that can be closed. When [`Closer::close`] is called or
/// object goes out of scope, it becomes closed. Owner of [`Closer`] can share a read-only
/// view of the "closed" state to multiple listeners. Read-only access is provided by [`Closable`]
/// which can be obtained by calling [`Closer::to_closable`].
///
/// # Usage
///
/// Use a standalone [`Closer`].
///
///```rust
/// use maviola::core::utils::closable::{Closer, Closable};
///
/// let closer = Closer::new();
/// assert!(!closer.is_closed());
///
/// let closable_1 = closer.to_closable();
/// let closable_2 = closable_1.clone();
///
/// assert!(!closable_1.is_closed());
/// assert!(!closable_2.is_closed());
///
/// drop(closer);
///
/// assert!(closable_1.is_closed());
/// assert!(closable_2.is_closed());
/// ```
///
/// It is possible to "share" [`Closer`] using [`Arc`]. In such case a resource will be closed only
/// once all copies will come out of scope:
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use maviola::core::utils::closable::{Closer, Closable};
///
/// let closer_1 = Arc::new(Closer::new());
/// let closer_2 = closer_1.clone();
///
/// let closable_1 = closer_1.to_closable();
/// let closable_2 = closable_1.clone();
///
/// drop(closer_1);
///
/// assert!(!closer_2.is_closed());
/// assert!(!closable_1.is_closed());
/// assert!(!closable_2.is_closed());
///
/// drop(closer_2);
///
/// assert!(closable_1.is_closed());
/// assert!(closable_2.is_closed());
///```
