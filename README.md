Maviola
=======

A high-level [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/) communication library written in Rust. Maviola provides abstractions like
communication nodes and namespaces and takes care of **stateful** features of the MAVLink protocol, such as sequencing,
message time-stamping, automatic heartbeats, simplifies message signing, and so on.

Maviola is based on [Mavio](https://gitlab.com/mavka/libs/mavio), a low-level library with `no-std` support. If you are
looking for a solution for embedded devices, then Mavio would be a better option.

> **âš  WIP**
> 
> Maviola is still under heavy development. The aim is to provide API similar to
> [`gomavlib`](https://github.com/bluenviron/gomavlib) with additional support for essential MAVLink
> ["microservices"](https://mavlink.io/en/services/) such as [heartbeat](https://mavlink.io/en/services/heartbeat.html),
> [parameter protocol](https://mavlink.io/en/services/parameter.html) and
> [commands](https://mavlink.io/en/services/command.html).
> 
> We intentionally do not publish early versions of API to avoid confusion and massive breaking changes.

Examples
--------

Basic examples of client-server communication for different transports:

* TCP
  ```shell
  cargo run --package maviola --example tcp_ping_pong
  ```
* UDP
  ```shell
  cargo run --package maviola --example udp_ping_pong
  ```
* Unix sockets
  ```shell
  cargo run --package maviola --example sock_ping_pong
  ```
